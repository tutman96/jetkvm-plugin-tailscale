> This repo has been archived since there seemed to be little desire for having a plugin system as a whole. Now that JetKVM supports TUN devices natively, the need for having a complex plugin is nearly removed other than providing a better UX

# Tailscale JetKVM Plugin
This is a plugin for the JetKVM to add Tailscale support. It implements a simple TLS proxy to expose the JetKVM interface to the tailnet as well as a WebRTC TURN server to provide a mechanism to proxy WebRTC traffic through the tailnet without kernel-level TUN device support.

## Installing
The [Releases Page](https://github.com/tutman96/jetkvm-plugin-tailscale/releases) contains pre-build plugin tars. In order to install this onto the JetKVM, make sure to have a version built and deployed with support for the [Plugin System](https://github.com/jetkvm/kvm/pull/10). Then navigate to the settings and upload the tar archive.

## Building
If you would rather build this yourself, feel free to use the `./build.sh` script located in this repo to do that.

Alternatively you can run `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 go build .` to build the `jetkvm-plugin-tailscale` binary.

Run `tar -czvf tailscale.tar.gz manifest.json jetkvm-plugin-tailscale` to build the plugin archive

## Debugging
If you would like to debug this plugin prior to logging being implemented in the JetKVM plugin system. Simply create a file `debug` in the plugin's working directory (`/userdata/jetkvm/plugins/working_dirs/tailscale`) which you can do by SSHing into the device and running

```sh
touch /userdata/jetkvm/plugins/working_dirs/tailscale/debug
```

When posting any issues, please share the debug logs if available to make it easier to diagnose issues.
